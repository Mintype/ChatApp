# ChatApp
## Inspiration
We wanted to create our way to communicate with friends and family. Nowadays, texting has become a crucial method of communication.

## What it does
People can run their client and communicate with other people using the server.

## How we built it
We built it using the Java programming language.

## Challenges we ran into
We had a tough time connecting our clients to the server, due to the various firewalls present in our school's network. Using GitHub to collaborate with other team members.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a server and client that can communicate with each other. We are proud to make it functional.

## What we learned
We learned how to use sockets and threads in Java.

## What's next for Chatting Application (Console)
Add a GUI to the application to make it more presentable.
